# Hi, I'm Prabhav 👋

Right now I’m building a **Parkinson’s UPDRS forecasting app** (XGBoost + Streamlit) that turns routine clinic scores into short-term symptom forecasts. The goal of this project is to help families see the **near-term symptom burden** coming up—useful for planning day-to-day life and for **earlier conversations with clinicians**. I focus on **UPDRS I** (non-motor symptoms) because changes there can flag broader needs—sleep hygiene, mood support, or a medication review—even when motor scores look stable. *Educational tool, not medical advice.*
